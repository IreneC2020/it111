<h1> Where to stay?</h1>

    <h2>Business Hotel</h2>

<img class="right" src="images/hotel.jpg" alt="Hotel">   
<p>Rooms of business hotel are small but clean, usually have WiFi, and as they are aimed at businessmen. They usually come equipped with everything you might need: towels, soap, shampoo, toothbrush, comb, robe. They always have a private bathroom, desk, fridge, and kettle.</p>

<p>Some business hotels we’ve stayed in have laundry facilities, free breakfast, and even an onsen bath. </p>
    

<h2>Capsule Hotel</h2>
<img class="left" src="images/capsule.jpg" alt="capsule">   
<p>A capsule hotel (カプセルホテル), also known as a pod hotel, is a type of hotel developed in Japan that features many small bed-sized rooms known as capsules. Capsule hotels provide cheap, basic overnight accommodation for guests who do not require or who cannot afford larger, more expensive rooms offered by more conventional hotels.</p>

<p>The guest room is a chamber roughly the length and width of a single bed, with sufficient height for a hotel guest to crawl in and sit up on the bed. Like a hostel, many amenities are communally shared, including toilets, showers, wireless internet, and dining rooms. </p>
    
    

<h2>Minshuku</h2>
<img class="right" src="images/minshuku.jpg" alt="Minshuku">   
<p>Minshuku (民宿) are family-operated, Japanese-style bed and breakfasts. They offer visitors a good opportunity to meet local families and experience the traditional Japanese lifestyle. Minshuku are typically located around tourist areas such as hot springs, ski resorts and in the mountains. They are also commonly found in smaller countryside cities and towns or by the sea. </p>



    <h2>Airbnb</h2>
<img class="left" src="images/airbnb.jpg" alt="Airbnb">   
<p>Airbnb faced  very strict restrictions a year ago when the government trying to set up rules minimize the disturbance to the normal life of local residents. But lately, Airbnb and other home-sharing services are recovering in Japan.</p>

<p>In Japan, Airbnb is often significantly cheaper than staying in a hotel, especially with multiple guests. Staying in a house or apartment also gives you a more “local” experience, and you may have extra conveniences that you wouldn’t get at a hotel, such as a kitchen or washing machine.</p>
    

    <h2>Ryokan</h2>
<img class="right" src="images/ryokan_main.jpg" alt="Ryokan">   
<p>A ryokan (旅館) is a traditional Japanese inn. When you are planning where to stay in Japan, adding a ryokan to your itinerary will be an unique experience.</p>

<p>They are more expensive than standard hotel rooms but are worth trying. Don't forget the include the meal in your stay to have a complete Japan adventure.</p>

<h3> Ryokan 101</h3>
<img class="center" src="images/ryokan.jpg" alt="ryokan">

<p> Ryokan(旅館)are traditional inns located all across Japan, and a must for anyone looking to have an authentic, incredible accommodation experience during their trip. Here are things you may want to know before you stay in Ryokan.</p>
<dl>
    <dt><strong>Shoes</strong></dt>
    <dd>All Japanese ryokan will expect guests to remove their shoes when they enter the lobby, or at the building's entrance area. Never wear shoes or slippers anywhere there's a tatami floor, or into bathrooms—bathrooms have special slippers that are for bathroom use only! </dd>
    <dt><strong>Onsen</strong></dt>
    <dd>One of the best reasons to stay at a ryokan is for access to the baths they have on the premises. Many have onsen hot springs, complete with an outdoor bath so visitors can enjoy a relaxing soak immersed in nature.</dd>
    <dt><strong>Yukata</strong></dt>
    <dd>A yukata is a light, cotton kimono that can be thought of as a Japanese-style dressing gown or robe. The ryokan will provide yukata to their customers—they'll be placed in rooms ahead of time, or collected from the front desk at check-in. </dd>
    <dt><strong>Kaiseki ryori</strong></dt>
    <dd>Kaiseki ryori (会席料理) is traditional Japanese multi-course haute cuisine. Its origins are found many centuries ago in the simple meals served at the tea ceremony. Today, it can be enjoyed by staying at a ryokan.</dd>
